Title->Bubble sorting

Aim->To learn about objrct oriented programming in C++)

Theory->Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. 

Algorithm :
Start=>Initialize an integer array arr with the elements to be sorted and set its size.=>Start a loop with a variable j from 0 to size - 1 (inclusive). This loop controls the number of passes through the array=>Inside the outer loop, start another loop with a variable i from 0 to size - j - 2 =>Within the inner loop=>Compare arr[i] with arr[i+1]=>Continue the inner loop until all elements have been compared and swapped as necessary for this pass=>After the inner loop completes, the largest unsorted element is moved to the end of the array, and the outer loop counter j is incremented by 1=>After all passes are completed, the array arr will be sorted in ascending order=>Outside the loops, print the sorted array arr=>End

Explanation of the code:
Start with an array of elements to be sorted.Repeatedly compare adjacent elements in the array and swap them if they are in the wrong order.Continue this process for each element in the array, gradually moving the largest unsorted element to the end.After each pass through the array, one more element is correctly positioned at the end.Repeat this process for all elements in the array until the entire array is sorted.Print the sorted array.Bubble Sort works by iteratively "bubbling up" the largest unsorted element to its correct position in the array, making the array increasingly sorted with each pass.
